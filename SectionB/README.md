## Introduction

I have been using a lot of Typescript lately with Javascript frameworks such as NodeJS(Express) and React(NextJS) and the first ever project I created was a clone of an anonymous message sender app but I went ahead and added a database to use it a Q&A like platform but the responses are anonymous.

- Project Name:     AnonySender
- Github URL:       https://github.com/JohannesMogashoa/anony-sender
- Live Version:     https://anony-sender.vercel.app/

Apart from the above mentioned project, I have currently been working on my own little command line tool that will make picking a template that already comes with the tools and technologies I want preconfigured and all I do is install the dependencies and start working which removes the hassle of opening up docs looking for the same code snippets I will probably be copying and pasting many many times. This particular project was inspired by [Theo Browne](https://github.com/theobr).

- Project Name:     Create-T3-App
